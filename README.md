# ESP8266_Volt_Clock
Analog Voltmeter clock powered by ESP8266 and NTP

Analog Voltmeter clock. Uses ESP8266 via Arduino IDE. Pulls time via NTP. Adjust timezone in file for a different location.

Includes 3 PWM outputs for Hour, Minutes and Seconds. Adjust MAX PWM for each channel so everything lines up. Also has 3 LED outputs.

Made in the hardware style of https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/akc9ft/i_made_a_clock_from_analogue_voltmeters/ but using 3.3V. I used 3K resistors for the voltage.
